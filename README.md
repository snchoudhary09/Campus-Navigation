# Campus-Navigation
Using Graph theory to find the shortest path between two locations.

In this Project , we used four algorithm for determining shortest path between two loactions.<br>
1.A-star Algorithm<br>
2.Dijkstra's Algorithm<br>
3.Bellman's Ford Algorithm<br>
4.Floyd Warshall Algorithm<br>

For this Project,we chose 14 hot locations inside the IITJ Campus.
